This project calculates the amount of tax needed to be paid in a fictional world. It is based off of income and partly randomization. The meat of the process is being able to get the least amount of coins needed to pay. Using modular division and a version of the Euclidian Algorithm, this was achieved. 

The program receieves an input name to output personalized welcome messages and also gets an income value with two decimals flaoting to begin. It then first applies a randomly generated tax rate to 3 decimals and applies that to get the amount needed to be paid in tax. That amount is then put through an algorithm to yeild the proper amount of coins (minimum amount) needed to be paid by the inputed name. There is then a table generated to cleanly display the coin breakdown and also a message from the king using if, elif, else.
